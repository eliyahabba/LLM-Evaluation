Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order Choices: A. valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort. B. valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions. C. invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.

The man and his purported second wife bought a home together as tenants by the entirety. They lived there together for a few years, when the man was accused and convicted of killing his purported wife. He was given a life sentence. The decedent's estate brought a quiet title action to declare the property forfeited to the decedent on the basis that a murderer cannot benefit from his crime.

Under the common law, will the appellate court affirm the trial court's decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home? Choices: A. Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing. B. Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase. C. No, the court will as a policy matter recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common. D.
