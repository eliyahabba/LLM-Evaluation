So, the total age of the twins is 2T and the total age of the triplets is 3t.\n\nThe combined ages of all the children is 44, so we can set up the equation: 2T + 3t = 44.\n\nSubstituting T = t + 7 into the equation, we get: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44.\n\nExpanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + 3t = 44.\n\nCombining like terms, we get: 5t + 14 = 44.\n\nSubtracting 14 from both sides, we get: 5t = 30.\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get: t = 6.\n\nNow that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin: T = t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13.\n\nSo, one of the twins is 13 years old.",

    "To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die. There are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nThe numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes.\n\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.\n\nTo find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then another even number on the second roll.\n\nThe even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes for rolling an even number.\n\nThe probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.\n\nThe probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.\n\nSince the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nNow, to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we subtract the probabilities: 50% - 25% = 25%.\n\nSo, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.",

    "Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that C + W = 20 (since there are 20 animals in total).\n\nWe also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70. So, we can write the equation: 2C + 4W = 70.\n\nSince C + W = 20, we can express W as W = 20 - C. Substituting this into the second equation, we get: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.\n\nExpanding the equation, we get: 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.\nCombine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.\nSubtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.\nDivide by -2: C = 5.\n\nSo, there are 5 chickens on the farm.",

    "Each year, Carlos will earn 7 * $1.5 = $<<7*1.5=10.50>>10.50 from the lemons.\nHowever, it costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree, so his net earnings per year will be $10.50 - $3 = $<<10.5-3=7.50>>7.50.\nTo find out how many years it will take for him to start earning money, we need to divide the initial cost by his net earnings per year: $90 / $7.50 = <<90/7.5=12>>12.\nSo, it will take 12 years for Carlos to pay off the initial cost of the tree. However, since the question asks when he will start earning money, the answer is the next year after the cost is paid off, which is 12 + 1 = 13 years, but since he will be earning money in the 12th year (just not have earned more than the cost), the correct answer is that it will take 12 years for him to start earning money on the lemon tree after the initial investment is paid off, but he will be earning money in the 12th year, so the tree will start earning money after 12 years of planting, but the 12th year is included in the years he is earning money, so the correct answer is that the tree will be earning money after the initial 12 years, so the tree will take 12 years to start earning money after it is planted, but the tree will be earning money in the 12th year. \nThe final answer is 12 years after the tree is planted, the tree will be earning money, but the tree will take 12 years to pay off the debt, so the tree will take 12 years to start earning money after it is planted.",

    "To roll a number greater than 3, Jerry has 3 options: 4, 5, or 6. This means the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, or 50%.\n\nTo roll two even numbers in a row, Jerry has 3 options for the first roll (2, 4, or 6) and 3 options for the second roll (2, 4, or 6). The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also 1/2 = 0.5. So the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25, or 25%.\n\nThe difference between these probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%. To express this as a percentage increase, we can divide the difference by the original probability and multiply by 100: (25% / 25%) * 100 = 100%. So it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.\n\nThe answer is 100%.",

    "Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. Since 3 small stickers are worth 1 large button, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.\n\nShe has 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. Since 1 large sticker is worth 1 large button, she gets 20 large buttons.\n\nShe trades the rest of her large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons. But since a small sticker is worth 1 small button, she actually gets 60 small buttons, which is equivalent to 60 / 1 = 60 small buttons. However, we are interested in the number of buttons, not stickers. Since 1 small sticker is worth 1 small button, the 3 small stickers she didn't trade are worth 3 small buttons. \n\nIn total, she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons from trading small and large stickers. She also has the small buttons equivalent to the 3 small stickers she didn't trade, which is 3 small buttons. \n\nThe answer is the total number of buttons, which is 29 large buttons + 60 small buttons (from the large stickers) + 3 small buttons (from the small stickers she didn't trade) = 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons. However, the problem asks for the total number of buttons, and we should express the answer in terms of the total number of buttons, without distinguishing between large and small buttons. Since 1 large button is worth 3 small buttons, 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons. \n\nSo, the total number of buttons is 87 (from large buttons) + 63 (from small buttons) = 150 buttons.\n\nThe answer is 150.",
