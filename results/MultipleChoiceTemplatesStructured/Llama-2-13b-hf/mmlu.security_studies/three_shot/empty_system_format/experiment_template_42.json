Choices: I. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. II. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. III. All of these options. IV. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory. Answer:\nIII.

The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility.

II. High rates of morbidity amongst infected patients posed a direct threat to human security. With most fatalities occurring within young, otherwise healthy adult populations, serious questions about future economic and other sectors of security were raised. III. Quarantine and isolation procedures were implemented by some national health agencies, restricting the movements of those perceived to be at risk of being infected with the virus. IV.

As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely. II. Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism. III. Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system. IV.

State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice. II. With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves. III. The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC. IV. The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.

Choices: I. Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. II. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. III. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. IV. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time.

Choices: I. Weak state insecurity in a historical framework of analysis represents an abnormal state in the long term state-building process. Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence. II. The utility of explaining weak state insecurity with a comparison to the historical conditions of state consolidation in Europe does not stand in the contemporary context of global society because of the pervasion of international norms to prevent violent conflict from manifesting in the consolidation process. III. The contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms, a particular problematic rule of which is sovereignty. Thus, unlike some European entities which could not complete the state-building process and were absorbed into more viable units, weak states will remain quasi entities. IV. Weak state insecurity originated from the denial of sovereignty as the norm and the corresponding extension of the right to inviolability of statehood. Without protection under international laws the possibility of its national status being revoked and its territory being subsumed into another state threatens the consolidation of the state-building process.

Choices: I. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\nIV.

Choices: I. The distinction between domestic and international attacks has become increasingly widened, particularly the difference between domestic orientated terrorism - such as the removal of a government figure - and externally directed activities where objectives may be ideological. II. Statistics show that instances of domestic terrorism are decreasing. International occurrences can be ten times higher in the figures of injuries and deaths, which may be attributable to the larger scale of force employed in terrorist operations. Successive numbers of internationally directed incidents of terrorism in 2002, 2003, and 2004, were higher than those in 2001. III. Terrorism is the single gravest threat to international security in the contemporary world, and domestic and international terrorist attacks are responsible for a greater number of deaths in recent years than any form of military, conventional or non-conventional warfare. IV. The extensity and effect of international terrorism is contentious. Domestic acts of violence continue to be the most prevalent form of terrorism, the predominant difference being that international terrorist acts generate greater media attention. Answer:\nIV.

Choices: I. Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. II. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. III. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. IV. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time. The lack of an agreed definition on what constitutes human security makes the possibility of developing a framework unlikely. Answer:\nIII.

Choices: I. Biology determines the female body as weak, ensuring that men continue to dominate state security apparatus in order to protect them. Women are aware of practical biological differences, and by accepting them they allow men to act as their protectors and care-givers. In return, women must act as protectors and care-givers to those less capable than themselves, their children, infants, the elderly, and the infirm. II. The most intimate of human activities for women are more important than the demands of the political and religious male dominated elite. Biology determines, and woman's intimate choice exerts, that the considerable responsibility of reproducing a state's population becomes the duty of women alone. III. Indiscriminate warfare is gender neutral and in contemporary conflicts there is no gender difference in levels of risk or duty. Men are just as likely to become victims of mass rape (as in the Democratic Republic of Congo or Balkans conflict) as women, and women are equally likely to be conscripted or coerced into military service. IV. Gender roles are a social construct; the values that we attribute to masculinity or femininity, such as strength or care-giving, are the product of shared social ideals rather than innate biological properties.

Choices: I. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. II. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. III. All of these options. IV. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory. Answer:\nIII.

II. A sense of national identity can be developed through a variety of shared experiences, including war. The glorification of iconic national figures such as political leaders is not noticeably gendered and men and women generally perform the same types of roles within the public realm. III. Measures of national pride and success are biased towards the glorification of female attributes such as the ability to bear children. The restriction of women to the domestic sphere creates a sense of national identity that is founded on a celebration of home life, feminine strength, and maternal characteristics. IV.

Choices: I. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\nIV.

Successive numbers of internationally directed incidents of terrorism in 2002, 2003, and 2004, were higher than those in 2001. III. Terrorism is the single gravest threat to international security in the contemporary world, and domestic and international terrorist attacks are responsible for a greater number of deaths in recent years than any form of military, conventional or non-conventional warfare. IV. The extensity and effect of international terrorism is contentious. Domestic acts of violence continue to be the most prevalent form of terrorism, the predominant difference being that international terrorist acts generate greater media attention. Answer:\nIV.

Choices: I. One of the founding assumptions of Critical Security Studies is that theories about the world constitute that world and thus that theory, including security theory, has political effects. The consequence is that theory is the product of the system, and that analyses of the agent of security and the referent object is produced by its own practices. II. Central to the political and critical nature of post-structural literature is the idea of fostering an ethos of democracy and an ethos of critique which is finite and attainable. It is to this end that we must strive, but one that can only be met under the conditions prescribed, that of true democracy. III. A central notion of critique is to provide an answer to the problem of what it means to be critical. This invariably raises the question of revealing the interest behind knowledge claims with the goal of social change, what is accepted as the end of theory: that the practical and contextual understandings inform to whom knowledge claims serve.

Choices: I. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility.

Choices: I. A terrorist attack is that which uses the threat or use of organized violence to achieve political objectives. This may include kidnappings and organized violence for financial gain, and such attacks can be undertaken by groups or individuals. II. Organization is essential for a successful campaign to bring about the political goals that are being sought. An act of terrorism targets an audience that extends beyond the immediate victims and is characterized as being a weapon of the weak. III. Terrorist violence is a form of psychological warfare that generates fear in a target audience by attacking members of that group. Selected targets are chosen at random from a cross-section of groups within the state ranging from political representatives, security forces, civilians or law enforcement. Random acts of violence contribute to the sense of insecurity and societal instability. IV. Terrorism is a broad concept that is understood to denote the threat or use of organized violence for the attainment of political objectives.

Choices: I. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\nIV.

The Global War on Terror has had a positive effect on the state-building project. The fight against terrorism has redirected international attention and resources towards eradicating insecurities as part of the recognition of the multilevel factors facilitating the emergence of terrorism. Specifically this involves the controlling of the proliferation of arms. II. The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism. The problem thus far is that no one case of enforced neo-liberalism, either through conditionalities, regime change, peace-building, has succeeded in transforming a weak state into a strong state. III. The failure of liberal reform has highlighted the increasing viability of the option of alternative forms of political organization beyond the state. Sub-state organizations are a practical solution to dealing with regions with endemic problems of weapons and poverty, whilst regional organization is a sustainable structural form in Africa and Latin America.

The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare.

Choices: I. There is a developing scholarly trend toward proliferation pessimism, a pattern which has gained momentum rather than subsided with the end of the Cold War. There is concern that accidental war may occur, either through misperception, psychological or technical problems that can lead to spiralling tensions which result in a failure of deterrence policy. In addition, normal accidents resulting from the inability of a state to capably anticipate human-machine interactions in the complexities of the international (and anarchical) system may also occur. II. Proliferation optimists dispute the claim that nuclear technology leads to a propensity of the holding actor towards war. They do concede that there is the risk that terrorists acquiring the weapon could create an existential threat to the international system, although the threat is not yet a reality. Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain. III. Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat. However there is agreement that the spread of WMD capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed whilst the possibility exists, states will have to heighten security efforts. IV. Deterrence has proved to have been a source of stabilization during the Cold War but proliferation pessimists contend that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians. Weak state structures might result in sabotage, accidental use, or even theft. There is also the problem of states developing technology under the guise of deterrence whilst having ulterior motives.

In practice this means that the coercer must be militarily superior and capable of denying their opponent the ability to realize their agenda and impose costs that directly threaten their interests.

Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. II. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. III. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. IV. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time.

The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare.

A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. II. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term.

Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. III. All of these options. IV. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime.

The state on a practical level remains the most capable body - having the monopolization over the instruments of violence, and centralization of resources - to enter into trans-national agreements for the management of environmental constraints.

Possession of WMD may act as a deterrence to stronger opponents against potential threat, or be used to defeat their adversaries if engaged in combat. WMD capabilities may also be developed to gain automatic status and diplomatic influence amongst the international community. II. Although there are fears posed by WMD proliferation that terrorists may gain the capacity to develop weapons, it would remain very difficult to construct even a primitive gun-type nuclear weapon.

This means that the potential threats posed by each type of weapon are different. High yield, lightweight nuclear weapons use cutting-edge technology, whilst some chemical and biological weapons have been available for a long time.

Choices: I. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\nIV.

Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. II.

Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. III. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. IV.

Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. II. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. III. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. IV. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time.

Choices: I. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\nIV.

In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT one of the 3 forms of violence identified by postcolonialism?

Choices: I. Democratization and nationalism inhibits the opportunity for terrorism: nationalism provides the ideological dynamic to unify ethnic differences, and democracy allows for the articulation of grievances in a constructive manner. Within this analysis states with weak democratic and nationalist credentials may provide the conditions that contribute to the development of terrorism. II. Terrorism amongst Islamic groups is developed on ethnocentric lines opposed to the secularism that accompanies modernity. It is perhaps ironic that whilst terrorism was organized around the threat to Islamic society in the Middle East, the response to threat has resulted in groups in Europe feeling threatened by Muslim intrusion on Western values.

A potential future danger is that a suicide attack could be combined with the use of chemical, biological or radiological weapons. II. The ability to find vulnerable targets may be greater in democratic states since there are limitations on how much a government can monitor its citizen and will, in the event of an attack, generate more publicity. However, security forces in weak non-democratic countries also provide conditions conducive to terrorist activity, enabling relative freedom of operation and movement. III. WMD have not been used very often, requiring high levels of resources and trained personnel for use.

Choices: I. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. II. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. III. All of these options. IV. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory. Answer:\nIII. All of these options.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: In what ways has the global energy environment affected the security of oil producing states? Choices: I.

Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. II. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. III. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. IV. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time.

Choices: I. Transnational crime is regarded as a threat to economic development. Organized crime is seen as a threat to development insofar as it undermines the rule of law and deters foreign investment by increasing the level of insecurity in the host communities. Additionally, criminals often reinvest their proceeds in the legal economy and have unfair advantage through access to cheap capital and their ability to intimidate commercial adversaries. In societies with high levels of TNC, legitimate investors are often reluctant to commit resources. II. TNC undermines democratic stability. In many states, transnational criminal enterprises have taken advantage of the instability that has accompanied the democratic transitions to post communist societies, using their influence in the upper reaches of the state and thus shielding themselves from law enforcement. The corruption of public institutions and the perceived inefficacy of the rule of law in new democracies contribute to undermining public confidence in and loyalty to the new regime. III. The ability of transnational crime to evade state border controls and provide new avenues for the illicit transportation of goods and persons challenges the state's ability to exercise its core functions as guarantor of national sovereignty, the monopolization over the control of force, and as the provider of the common good. TNC criminal activities corrupt and undermine numerous state agencies, providing mechanisms by which their activities can affect the very nature of government and state policy in the host countries.

Choices: I. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. II. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. III. All of these options. IV. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory. Answer:\nIII.

There was a wave of terrorist violence in Europe in the 1970s and 1980s rooted in various leftist and Marxist ideologies but these began to wane by the late 1980s. Right-wing groups are also present, often with overtly xenophobic and racist views, targeting migrants and foreign workers. III. Groups defined by their ethnic or linguistic identifications are a broad category for the organization of terrorist groups. In some countries a large number of anti-colonial groups were ethnically based and used terrorist tactics in the wars of liberation. Such loyalties and tactics have in some cases proved immutable post-independence.

The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles.

Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society.

Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. II.

Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. III. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. IV. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time.

Choices: I. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. II. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. III. All of these options. IV. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime.

Choices: I. Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. II. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. III. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. IV. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time. The lack of an agreed definition on what constitutes human security makes the possibility of developing a framework unlikely. Answer:\nIII.

Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. II. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. III. All of these options. IV. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime.

Choices: I. The distinction between domestic and international attacks has become increasingly widened, particularly the difference between domestic orientated terrorism - such as the removal of a government figure - and externally directed activities where objectives may be ideological. II. Statistics show that instances of domestic terrorism are decreasing. International occurrences can be ten times higher in the figures of injuries and deaths, which may be attributable to the larger scale of force employed in terrorist operations. Successive numbers of internationally directed incidents of terrorism in 2002, 2003, and 2004, were higher than those in 2001. III. Terrorism is the single gravest threat to international security in the contemporary world, and domestic and international terrorist attacks are responsible for a greater number of deaths in recent years than any form of military, conventional or non-conventional warfare.

Choices: I. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\nIV.

Choices: I. Coercive diplomacy has proven a successful policy tool and one that is integral to conflict management. The successes of the past policy initiatives in the post-9/11 community have reinforced the trend toward coercive diplomacy by increasing American political will to counter mass casualty terrorism in failing states. II. The favourable geo-political environment, characterized by an overwhelmingly Western military superiority and a low risk of hostile great power intervention, has generated pressures and incentives for Western policymakers to promote their policy agenda, and to manage armed conflicts from weak states and failing states.

Risk of uncontrollable escalation still remains but in a different form; mass casualty terrorism, contagion from failing states and non-state actors seeking to acquire WMD are the primary concern of states and require responses in the form of military intervention. IV. The hostile geopolitical environment has encouraged states to pursue military strategies in order to secure their interests.

Choices: I. The distinction between domestic and international attacks has become increasingly widened, particularly the difference between domestic orientated terrorism - such as the removal of a government figure - and externally directed activities where objectives may be ideological. II. Statistics show that instances of domestic terrorism are decreasing. International occurrences can be ten times higher in the figures of injuries and deaths, which may be attributable to the larger scale of force employed in terrorist operations. Successive numbers of internationally directed incidents of terrorism in 2002, 2003, and 2004, were higher than those in 2001. III.

Choices: I. A nuclear blast produces EMP, a thermal light pulse, blast, and fallout at the moment of detonation. The electro-magnetic pulse occurs when gamma radiation interacts with matter (the atmosphere), \"the Compton effect.\" EMP produces a high voltage charge, harmless to humans but destructive to electronic systems. EMP effects are maximized at high altitude. However thermal-light pulse can produce flash blindness, retinal burn, and fire whilst the airburst can cause severe skin burns. II. A nuclear detonation produces a shockwave resulting from a rise in atmospheric pressure and dynamic overpressure sufficient to destroy concrete structures. Blast effects were generally used by military planners to calculate casualty rates in a nuclear attack: It was estimated that 50 percent living in a five mile radius of a one-mgt airburst would be killed or wounded by blast effects. III. Nuclear reactions in the initial nuclear detonation or the fallout can cause radiation poisoning, as irradiated debris is picked up by the nuclear fireball and lofted into the atmosphere. A dirty bomb uses chemical high-explosive to disperse radioactive material, relying on radiation to produce a lethal effect. Panic set off by even a limited dispersion of radioactive material might be more costly in terms of the disruption it causes than actual casualties or damage to property produced by a dirty bomb detonation; some observers believe that the blast itself causes the greatest amount of damage.

Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. II. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. III. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. IV. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time.

Choices: I. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\nIV.

Choices: I. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. II. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. III. All of these options. IV. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory. Answer:\nIII.

Are they a help or a hindrance? Choices: I. Diplomacy cannot achieve agreements among small groups of nations where global agreements have failed. Global endorsement is required to legitimize the process, providing greater cooperation, agreements and great power backing. Failure to attain global consensus on what terrorism is will result in disparities between states' counterterrorism methods which will severely reduce the scope of employing multi-level measures in a consistent and cohesive fashion, and may afford some terrorist groups the opportunity to seek refuge in states whose domestic laws are weaker. II. A great deal of international diplomacy has involved attempts to define terrorism so that all countries could take steps to eradicate it.

Choices: I. Traditional security studies regards the search for empirically testable 'truths' to be detrimental to the pursuit of a practical analytical framework with which to study security, largely due to a recognition in the field that security was not limited to a narrow or easily defined set of 'real' principles. II. Knowledge was regarded as subjective and doubts were cast on whether any empirically testable 'truths' or realities could be defined for certain. III. Traditional security studies adopt a positivist approach, based in scientific objectivism that pursues the definition of specific 'truths' that can be empirically tested and validated. IV. Traditional security studies adopt a subjective approach to knowledge, based on the notion that what constitutes as a 'truth' or as a 'value' cannot be easily distinguished from one another.

Choices: I. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society.

The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty.

Choices: I. In order to secure the continuation of supplies from oil-rich nations, states in the North have utilised their diplomatic influence to bolster human security, promoting the growth of strong liberal democratic regimes that can operate securely on the free market. II. The political and economic spheres remain mutually exclusive from one another and state actors decline to intervene in the commercial aspects of oil production, instead leaving the responsibility to secure resources with international oil companies. III. In their attempts to secure the continuation of energy supplies, industrialised states provide military aid to the regimes of oil-rich states, having a vested interest in securing these regimes and thus protecting the status quo, often to the detriment of human security.

Choices: I. Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. II. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. III. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. IV. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time. The lack of an agreed definition on what constitutes human security makes the possibility of developing a framework unlikely. Answer:\nIII.

Choices: I. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\nIV.

The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare.

The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare.

Choices: I. Human security has put particular emphasis on the nexus between conflict and development, a concept which is very useful. The significance of the nexus between development and conflict is not just that it raises ethical issues about human suffering and inequalities, but that its frequent outcomes, so called state future, has dire local, regional, and global effects. II. From a normative perspective, the concept serves to highlight good global norms. Human security often serves as an umbrella norm. Developing good global norms is not only important for moral and ethical reasons but also because they serve to enhance state and international society. III. The development of the human security concept highlights the view that the threats to humans as well as to state entities are changing and increasing. These changes have spurred debates about the meaning of security and the arguments for its broadening and deepening.

Choices: I. The distinction between domestic and international attacks has become increasingly widened, particularly the difference between domestic orientated terrorism - such as the removal of a government figure - and externally directed activities where objectives may be ideological. II. Statistics show that instances of domestic terrorism are decreasing. International occurrences can be ten times higher in the figures of injuries and deaths, which may be attributable to the larger scale of force employed in terrorist operations. Successive numbers of internationally directed incidents of terrorism in 2002, 2003, and 2004, were higher than those in 2001. III. Terrorism is the single gravest threat to international security in the contemporary world, and domestic and international terrorist attacks are responsible for a greater number of deaths in recent years than any form of military, conventional or non-conventional warfare.

Choices: I. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\nIV.

Choices: I. Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. II. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. III. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. IV. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time.

Choices: I. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. II. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. III. All of these options. IV. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory. Answer:\nIII.

Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. II. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. III. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. IV. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time.

These are favoured because the target would find it difficult to contain the source of the outbreak, placing the infrastructure of the target country under strain. III. Biological agents comprise bacteria, viral, and toxin agents. However, not every disease provides the basis for an effective biological weapon. An agent's storage, delivery, mode of transmission and its very resilience can shape its effects on a target population. IV.

The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\nIV.

Choices: I. Fission nuclear weapons are gun-type devices that require a relatively small amount of fissile uranium-235 material to produce a comparatively large explosion because mass and energy becomes interchangeable in the barrel. Implosion devices however are unable to sustain the reaction; the neutron generator is unable to set off the interchange being destroyed in the explosion. II. Implosion fissure devices are constructed with relative ease because unlike the gun-type fissure device it uses high-explosive shaped lenses to compress the fissile material to critical tolerance. Detonation is highly volatile with a high potential of \"going critical\". III. Fissile weapons are produced by the rapid rearrangement of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen in a chamber, striking each other at high velocities the friction sparking a chemical explosion. IV. Gun-type devices are of rugged design using two sub-critical masses fired down a barrel at very high velocities with a high probability of producing a reaction.

Choices: I. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. II. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. III. All of these options. IV. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory. Answer:\nIII.

Choices: I. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\nIV.

Choices: I. Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. II. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. III. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. IV. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time. The lack of an agreed definition on what constitutes human security makes the possibility of developing a framework unlikely. Answer:\nIII.

Choices: I. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. II. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. III. All of these options. IV. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory. Answer:\nIII.

Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. II. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. III. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. IV. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time.

II. Statistics show that instances of domestic terrorism are decreasing. International occurrences can be ten times higher in the figures of injuries and deaths, which may be attributable to the larger scale of force employed in terrorist operations. Successive numbers of internationally directed incidents of terrorism in 2002, 2003, and 2004, were higher than those in 2001. III.

Under these conditions reforms may become concessions that fuel the violence rather than a mechanism for ending it. It is also clear that reforms may not eliminate the presence of terrorism. II. Contemporary responses to terrorism have been taken within the context of the war on terror analogy, in which the norms of retaliation and punishment prevail. Implicit within this view is the justification for pre-emptive action taken against training facilities, headquarters, sources of funding, and even the assassination of key individuals. III. Whilst the warfare analogy presumes deterrence at times, deterrence is more central to a justice system.

II. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. III. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. IV. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare.

Choices: I. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. II. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. III. All of these options. IV. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime.

Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. II. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. III. All of these options. IV. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties.

Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. II. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. III. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. IV. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time.

Choices: I. The viability of the CWC and BCW providing a concrete basis in international law to prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is dubious. The Proliferation Security Initiative to prevent the illicit trade in materials relating to chemical and nuclear weapons is an equally piecemeal pursuit. Whilst they may serve some utility as a framework for diplomatic exchanges, they are essentially toothless bodies lacking the political will to establish an authority with the powers to police the control and use of these weapons. II. The International Non-proliferation Regime has been rendered effectively defunct in the post-Cold War climate. State actors seeking to develop their own weapons capabilities have de-stabilized norms governing the use and control of WMD. This has been evidenced by severe splits in the body following the 1998 Indian and Pakistani nuclear testing and the withdrawal of great power support following the US Senate's decision not to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. III. Contemporary concern has been pacified by the fact that WMD threat has greatly diminished with the end of the Cold War.

Choices: I. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. II. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. III. All of these options. IV. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory. Answer:\nIII. All of these options.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: As Cold War tensions declined, which three international issues emerged as new interested in the field of peace studies?

Economic security in the globalised international arena; localised environmental issues that potentially limited industrial expansion; and the Vietnam war, particularly in its capability to act as a drain on military and economic resources of the U.S.A. III. Primarily, the potential for a breakdown in d\u00e9tente and the subsequent escalation of Cold War tensions, leading to a focus on maintaining peace and the negotiations between East and West; secondly, a focus on the impacts of the Vietnam war that stems from this concern; and finally, a study of the development of post-colonial states.

Choices: I. Investigations into the consequences of state security policies showed that women were subject to masculine dominated war policies as the likely victims as casualties of war or as post conflict targets. Women are increasingly subject to violence as a product of social circumstance. II. Gendered consequences of security issues have not challenged international relations theory. Constructivist theories of the state were mainstreamed without undermining the ideas of state as the centre of military power, or as the highest organization of human community. III. Feminist and critical security theory shows us that war can have gendered consequences. Recognition of those consequences has allowed us to address the way in which we think about 'male' and 'female' expectations in warfare, and has shaped the way in which we theorise, participate, and protest against those roles. IV.

Choices: I. The distinction between domestic and international attacks has become increasingly widened, particularly the difference between domestic orientated terrorism - such as the removal of a government figure - and externally directed activities where objectives may be ideological. II. Statistics show that instances of domestic terrorism are decreasing. International occurrences can be ten times higher in the figures of injuries and deaths, which may be attributable to the larger scale of force employed in terrorist operations. Successive numbers of internationally directed incidents of terrorism in 2002, 2003, and 2004, were higher than those in 2001. III. Terrorism is the single gravest threat to international security in the contemporary world, and domestic and international terrorist attacks are responsible for a greater number of deaths in recent years than any form of military, conventional or non-conventional warfare. IV. The extensity and effect of international terrorism is contentious. Domestic acts of violence continue to be the most prevalent form of terrorism, the predominant difference being that international terrorist acts generate greater media attention. Answer:\nIV.

Choices: I. Prevention is normally associated with the concept of terrorism as war or crime. All governments will practice prevention (seen as repression from the terrorist perspective) by seeking to arrest or eliminate those actively involved in the violence. Security forces attack the terrorists before they strike (war) or they are arrested after the attack (crime). II. Large terrorist organizations are hard to penetrate, being highly cohesive and centralized in structure. In both the warfare and criminal model, intelligence is obtained by two methods; firstly to elicit information from captured terrorists or secondly from an informer within the group. An intelligence coup greatly enhances the prospect of stopping terrorist operations once the larger group has been compromised. III. Prevention of terrorism is a highly controversial policy designed to reduce the appeal of terrorism within the population through reform packages. The method is characterized by diplomatic exchanges. However, as a preventative method it has been questioned and it is argued to resemble concessionary politics. IV. Prevention is conceived as securing the physical integrity of targets and key political installations, particularly weapons installations, national buildings, national or cultural symbols, or defence deployments. Protecting possible targets of the state enhances the wellbeing of more vulnerable targets. Terrorists may move to more convenient territory to target their objectives which make it more difficult to control. Answer:\n", "Result": "III.

II. As levels of infection within a population rise, the potential for strategically important groups such as civil servants, judges, and government officials etc to become infected will also rise, thus directly challenging regime security.

Choices: I. The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is the second process of coercive diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy only fails if the coercer fails to achieve its defined goals and fails to defeat its adversary in the second stage. II. Generally the distinction between brute and limited force is negligible. Resort to air or sea power constitutes an equal coercive capacity to a conventional ground offensive. Military action always results from a failure of negotiations and from a shift from the diplomatic to the military sphere. III. The distinction between limited force and brute force is important because the amount of force that is used to attain the coercer's interests defines the type of outcome that is achieved. If a positive policy outcome is achieved, then we can say that limited force has been employed. IV. The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary.
